We actively monitor the `issues <https://github.com/FirelyTeam/firely-net-sdk/issues>`__ 
coming in through the GitHub repository.
You are welcome to register your bugs and feature suggestions there!

We are also present on `chat.fhir.org <https://chat.fhir.org>`__ on Zulip, on the dotnet stream,
or for more general implementation questions, the implementers stream.

For broader discussions, there's a `"FHIR on .NET" Google
group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/fhir-dotnet>`__.

You can also ask questions by sending an e-mail to fhirapi@fire.ly.

If you're interested in a FHIR training, or want to know what other FHIR tools are available,
please check `here <https://www.fire.ly//>`__.
