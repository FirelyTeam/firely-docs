Browse existing projects
========================
The Project Browser enables ordering and filtering all existing Simplifier.net projects. You can access the Project Browser through the home page of Simplfier.

Above the list of projects you will find an "Order By" dropdown menu. The available options in this menu are :

* Project Name 
* Project Key
* Project Scope
* Creation Date

You can use the filter to search for more specific projects. The filter pane starts with two options, namely Search by Project Name, and Filter on Project Scope. 
Filtering on Project Scope allows you to make a distinction between Core, International, National, Local, and Regional projects.
If you select the National Project Scope, the Nationality filter option will open. Here you can select one or more nationalities.
