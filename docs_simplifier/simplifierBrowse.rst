Browse existing projects
========================
The Project Browser enables ordering and filtering for all existing Simplifier.net projects. You can access the Project Browser through the home page for Simplfier.

Above the list for projects you will find an "Order By" dropdown menu. The available options in this menu are:

* Popularity 
* Project Name 
* Project Key
* Project Scope
* Creation Date

You can use the filter to search for more specific projects. For example you can filter based on Project Scope. This allows you to make a distinction between Core, International, National, Local, and Regional projects.
If you select the National Project Scope, the Nationality filter option will open. Here you can select one or more nationalities.
