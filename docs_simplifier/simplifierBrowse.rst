Browse existing projects
========================
To explore existing projects and resources simply type a search phrase into the ``Search`` field at the top of the Simplifier homepage. This search allows you to browse through publicly available resources and projects. Once you reach the page with your search results you will notice that you have a few options to further specify your results. In the left hand menu you will find options to limit the results to Resources or Profiles, include or exclude certain Resource Categories, and include or exclude results based on their Status and Scope.

You can use these filters to search for more specific projects. For example you can filter based on Project Scope. This allows you to make a distinction between Core, International, National, Local, and Regional projects. If you select the National Project Scope, the Nationality filter option will open. Here you can select one or more nationalities.

Your search results are now RESTful, meaning that you can send your search results exactly as you have edited them to another using the URL. The person that you are sending the results to will receive the search results just as you have filtered them.
