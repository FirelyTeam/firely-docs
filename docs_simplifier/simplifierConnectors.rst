Connectors
==========
A Connector is a script written by you or another community member. These scripts connects functionality from other websites or applications to Simplifier.net.
You can view your active connectors, shop for new connectors, or create or edit your own connectors via the Portal page.

Shop for Connectors
-------------------
In the Connectors Shop you can see a list of all available connectors. This list shows the Name, Description, Owner, Direction, and Resource Type of the Connector. To Subscribe to the Connector you want, simply press the Subscribe button.

Create/Edit Connectors
----------------------
On the Connectors - Create and Edit page you will see a Create Connector button and a list of your Connectors.

Using the Create Connector button or clicking an existing Connector will open the Connector Details page where you can enter or edit the Name, Description, Direction, and Resource Type.
To build or edit your script, click the Script Editor.

**Note**: All scripts will go through a proliferation process and will not be usable without the approval of a Simplifier.net Admin.
