Introduction to Simplifier.net
==============================

Simplifier.net is a FHIR registry. Within this registry you can
create, upload, download, find and view FHIR Conformance Resources.
Simplifier.net offers functionality for management of FHIR Resources
and collaboration in teams. 

FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) is an HL7 standard for information exchange in health care. It is based on Internet
technology. More information about FHIR can be found at `HL7 FHIR <http://www.hl7.org/fhir/>`_.

The FHIR Profiling tool `Forge (http://fhir.furore.com/forge) <http://fhir.furore.com/forge>`_ can be
used off-line and independently from Simplifier.net.

Simplifier.net distinguishes between free (personal) plans and paid
plans. Anyone can find and download Resources in this Registry, with
or without an account. Creating Resources requires an account. Paid
plans are targeted at professional users and organizations.

Simplifier.net is created and managed by Furore Health Informatics.
Furore is a health IT company based in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The
company was founded in 1993. Furore has been involved in FHIR since
the early beginning of FHIR in 2012. For more information about our
company, please visit `fhir.furore.com <http://fhir.furore.com>`_.

The new search feature allows you to filter search options for projects as well as publications. To access this new feature type a phrase in the “Search” box to see all the related results found. You can then further filter results by using the menu in the left hand column to filter results based on Project Scope, Publication Status, and Publication Categories.   You can also filter your search options within projects using the “Resources” tab and on the homepage via the “Browse all Projects…” link.
