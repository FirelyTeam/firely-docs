FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) is an HL7 standard for information exchange in health care. It is based on Internet
technology. More information about FHIR can be found at `HL7 FHIR <http://www.hl7.org/fhir/>`_.

The FHIR Profiling tool `Forge (http://fhir.furore.com/forge) <http://fhir.furore.com/forge>`_ can be
used off-line and independently from Simplifier.net.

Simplifier.net distinguishes between free (personal) plans and paid

plans are targeted at professional users and organizations.
