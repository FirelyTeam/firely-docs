Retrieving resource history
==============================

There are several ways to retrieve version history for resources with
the FHIR client.

Retrieving the history of a specific resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The version history of a specific resource can be retrieved with the
``History(System.Uri location, [System.DateTimeOffset? since = null], [int? pageSize = null])``
function. It returns a bundle with the history for the indicated
instance, for example:

.. code:: csharp

    var location = new Uri("http://spark.furore.com/fhir/Patient/31");
    Bundle results = client.History(location);

| Note that the Bundle may contain both ResourceEntries and
  DeletedEntries. It is possible to specify a date, to include only the
  changes that were made after the given date. Also you can specify the
  maximum number of results returned (see *Paged Results* below).
| Additionally, there is a ``History()`` overload where you can pass the
  location of the resource as a string in the first parameter instead.

Retrieving history for a type of resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you may want to retrieve the history for a **type** of
resource instead of an instance (e.g. the versions of all Patients). In
this case you can use
``TypeHistory<TResource>([System.DateTimeOffset? since = null], [int? pageSize = null])``:

.. code:: csharp

    Bundle results = client.TypeHistory<Patient>();

As with the previous function, a date and pagesize can optionally be
specified.

System wide history
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a system wide history is needed, retrieving all versions of all
resources, the FhirClient's
``WholeSystemHistory([System.DateTimeOffset? since = null], [int? pageSize = null])``
is used:

.. code:: csharp

    var lastMonth = DateTime.Today.AddMonths(-1);
    Bundle results = client.WholeSystemHistory(since: lastMonth, pageSize: 20);

In this case the function retrieves all changes to all resources that
have been done since the last month and limits the results to a maximum
of 20. Both these parameters are optional.

Paged Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, any FHIR server will limit the number of results returned in
the history. In the previous example, we explicitly limited the number
of results per page to 20.

The FhirClient has a ``Continue`` function to browse a search result
after the first page has been received using one of the ``History``
functions:

.. code:: csharp

    var result = client.TypeHistory<Patient>();

    while( result != null )
    {
        // Do something useful
        result = client.Continue(result);
    }

Note that ``Continue`` supports a second parameter that allows you to
browse forward, backward, or go immediately to the first or last page of
the result.
