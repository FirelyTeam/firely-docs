Searching for resources
========================

FHIR has extensive support for searching resources through the use of
the REST interface. Describing all the possibilities is outside the
scope of this document, but much more details can be found online in the
`specification <http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/fhir/search.html>`__.

The FHIR client has a few operations to do basic search.

Searching within a specific type of resource
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The most basic search is the client's
``Search<T>(string[] criteria = null, string[] includes = null, int? pageSize = null)``
function. It searches all resources of a specific type based on zero or
more criteria. Criteria must conform to the parameters as they would be
specified on the search URL in the REST interface, so for example
searching for all patients named 'Eve' would look like this

.. code:: csharp

    Bundle results = client.Search<Patient>(new string[] { "family:exact=Eve" });

The search will return a Bundle containing entries for each resource
found. It is even possible to leave out all criteria, effectively
resulting in a search that returns all resources of the given type.
Additionally, there is a ``Search()`` overload that does not use the
generic ``T`` argument, you can pass the type of resource as a string in
the first parameter instead.

Searching for a resource with a specific id
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In some cases you may already have the id of a specific resource (e.g.
an Observation with logical id ``123``, corresponding to the url
``Observation/123``). In this case you can use
``SearchById<T>(string id, string[] includes = null, int? pageSize = null)``.

Note that this function still returns a Bundle. The operation differs
from a ``Read<T>()`` operation because it can return *included*
resources as well. E.g. given an id ``123`` for an Observation, you can
ask a FHIR server to not only look for the indicated Observation but to
return the associated ``subject`` as well:

.. code:: csharp

    var incl = new string[] { "Observation.subject" };
    Bundle results = client.SearchById<Observation>("123", incl);

System wide search
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some servers allow you to execute searches across *all* resource types.
This would use FhirClient's
``WholeSystemSearch(string[] criteria = null, string[] includes = null, int? pageSize = null)``.

Doing this search:

.. code:: csharp

    Bundle results = client.WholeSystemSearch(new string[] { "name=foo" });

would then not only return Patients with "foo" in their name, but
Devices named "foo" as well.

Complex searches
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An alternative way to specify a query is by creating a ``Query``
resource and pass this to the client's ``Search(Query q)`` overload. The
``Query`` resource has a set of fluent calls to allow you to easily
construct more complex queries:

| \`\`\`csharp
| var q = new Query()
| .For("Patient").Where("name:exact=ewout")
| .OrderBy("birthDate", SortOrder.Descending)
| .SummaryOnly().Include("Patient.managingOrganization")
| .LimitTo(20);

| Bundle result = client.Search(q);
| \`\`\`

Note that unlike the search options shown before, you can specify search
ordering and the use of a summary result. As well, this syntax avoids
the need to create arrays of strings as parameters and tends to be more
readable.

Paged Results
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Normally, any FHIR server will limit the number of search results
returned. In the previous example, we explicitly limited the number of
results per page to 20.

The FhirClient has a ``Continue`` function to browse a search result
after the first page has been received using a ``Search``:

.. code:: csharp

    var result = client.Search(q);

    while( result != null )
    {
        // Do something useful
        result = client.Continue(result);
    }

Note that ``Continue`` supports a second parameter that allows you to
browse forward, backward, or go immediately to the first or last page of
the search result.
