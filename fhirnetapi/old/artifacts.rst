| ---

The FHIR distribution contains a host of support files that augment
FHIR's functionality and help developers do validation and other tasks.
This are files like validation XSD schemas, schematron files, profile
files etcetera.

Some of these files can be found on the web, some of those inside zip
files in the FHIR distribution and possibly some of them are provided as
individual files as part of the distribution of other FHIR software.

To help accessing these files, the FHIR .NET API contains the
``ArtifactResolver`` class, which has two main methods:

#. To locate a non-resource artifact, like an XSD file etcetera, call
   the resolver's ``ReadContentArtifact`` method, passing it the name of
   the file you are looking for:

.. code:: csharp

    var resolver = new ArtifactResolver();
    using(var fileStream = resolver.ReadContentArtifact("patient.sch"))
    {
        // read the schematron file from the stream, make sure to Dispose() it
        // or use a using() block
    }

#. To load a Profile, ValueSet or other artifact Resource, call
   ``ReadResourceArtifact``. Pass the full url of the artifact to the
   call:

.. code:: csharp

    var resolver = new ArtifactResolver();
    var address = new Uri("http://hl7.org/fhir/v2/vs/0292");
    ValueSet vs = resolver.ReadResourceArtifact(address);

To locate the indicated artifact, the ArtifactResolver executes the
following steps:

#. Try to find a file with the given filename in the current directory
   (this will often be the location the application's executable is
   running from). For Uri-based artifacts, the uri is interpreted as a
   FHIR endpoint and the "logical id" is used as the filename. This
   implies that if you try to locate a Profile called
   ``http://hl7.org/fhir/Profiles/us-core``, the resolver will try to
   read ``us-core.xml`` or ``us-core.json`` and parse it as a Profile.
#. Failing this, the resolver will try to find the artifact inside the
   ``validation.zip`` file which is part of the standard distribution.
   This zip contains all the FHIR core profiles, valuesets and schemas.
#. Failing this, the resolver will try to reach the endpoint (for
   Uri-based artifacts) and download the indicated artifact resource.

Tuning ArtifactResolver's behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the standard resolution steps described above does not fit your
situation, you can manipulate the ArtifactResolver's ``Sources``
property. This property contains a list of objects implementing
``IArtifactSource`` and which are tried in order to locate the desired
artifact. By default, the first source in this list is the
``FileArtifactSource``, the second the ``CoreZipArtifactSource`` and
last is the ``WebArtifactSource``. These sources can be manipulated or
you can plug-in your own ``IArtifactSource`` implementation to change
how the resolver works.

Using the FHIR XSD schemas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The FHIR distribution contains a set of XSD files supplied as an aid for
the validation of XML content. These files can be used to validate
individual resources and (atom) feeds.

Although you can get to these schema files using the
``ArtifactResolver``, the API facilitates access to the exact subset of
schemas you need for validation by means of the ``SchemaCollection``
class. The class has a single static property ``ValidationSchemaSet``
which returns a pre-compiled .NET XmlSchemaSet. This XmlSchemaSet can
then be used to validate resources, like so:

.. code:: csharp

    var doc = XDocument.Parse(value);
    doc.Validate(SchemaCollection.ValidationSchemaSet, validationEventHandler: null);
