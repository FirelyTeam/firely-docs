ElementModel Summary
========================

.. caution:: This documentation describes features in a prelease of version 1.0 of the API. The documentation may be outdated and code examples may become incorrect.

The interfaces and methods described in this section are summarized in the picture below. Note that there are more conversions possible than shown (e.g. reading from an ``XmlReader`` is not explicitly depicted), and the API may be extended to support formats other than XML and JSON by the time you read this.
