======================
Working with the model
======================

``Hl7.Fhir.Model`` contains model classes that correspond to the FHIR Resources and data types,
like Patient and HumanName. The code is generated by the FHIR publication tool, which is used to
build a new version of the `FHIR website <http://www.hl7.org/fhir>`__.

In this chapter, we will explain how to work with the model, and give you some code examples.
We also include a complete code example that sets up an instance of the Patient
resource, filling in values for several of the fields. We conclude the chapter with a discussion
of the Bundle resource type, plus some code examples of how to work with Bundles.
