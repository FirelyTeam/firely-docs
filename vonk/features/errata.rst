Errata to the specification
===========================

The FHIR Specification is good, but not perfect. Some of the SearchParameters have errors. If we find these errors, we report them in the issue tracking system of HL7. 
But it takes time until the fix is applied to the specification. In the meantime Vonk provides you with updated versions of the resources that have errors, so you can use them already while we await the fixes in the specification.

These corrections come with the Vonk installation, in the file ``errataR3.zip``, since they are corrections to the R3 / STU3 version of the specification. 
This file is imported automatically during startup, as are other conformance resources, see :ref:`conformance`.

Currently the errata.zip file contains the following corrections:
