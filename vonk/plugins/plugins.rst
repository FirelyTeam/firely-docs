Vonk FHIR Plugins
=================

Vonk FHIR Plugins is the means to adjust a Vonk FHIR Server to your own special needs, beyond the configuration.
Vonk FHIR Server is built as a pipeline of middleware, see :ref:`architecture` for more background on that.
Vonk FHIR Server allows you to put plugins of your own into that pipeline, and remove plugins that you do not need.
