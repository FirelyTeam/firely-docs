Welcome to the Vonk server documentation
=========================================

Vonk is the Furore FHIR server and the successor to our Spark server. 

.. The Spark server was intended to be
   a proof of concept implementation to test the HL7 FHIR specification and support the community during connectathons.
   Spark was not designed and built for production and as such is not easily adaptable to every situation.

Vonk is the answer to the growing need for a stable server that can be used in a variety of production environments.
The community edition of Vonk is publically available at vonk.furore.com. This edition is free to use and intended for
testing and educational purposes only.

installation, as well as information how to contact us when you have additional needs, such as a custom implementation
or support contract.
