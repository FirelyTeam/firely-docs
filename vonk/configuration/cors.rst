Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)
====================================

CORS is enabled in Vonk FHIR Server.
Since Vonk provides an API that is expected to be consumed by applications from different domains, CORS is enabled for any origin.
Currently there is no setting to control this behaviour.
