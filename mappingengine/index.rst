Welcome to the FHIR Mapper documentation
========================================

The FHIR Mapper is an implementation of the `FHIR mapping language <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html>`_, developed by Firely and `Healex <https://healex.systems>`_, available as a Firely Server plugin on the `Vonk marketplace <https://fire.ly/products/vonk/plugins/>`_. With this add-on you're able to transform data from a variety of formats - HL7 v2 or your custom ones - to other formats such as FHIR/custom resources. It can even be used to map FHIR resources between different profiles and FHIR versions.

More general information and tutorials about the FHIR Mapping Language can be found on the `HL7 wiki <https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/Using+the+FHIR+Mapping+Language>`_.
