Welcome to the .NET FHIR Mapping Engine documentation
=====================================================

The .NET FHIR Mapping Engine is Firely's implementation of the `mapping language <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/mapping-language.html>`_,
available as a Vonk plugin. With this engine you're able to transform data from a variety of formats - CDA, V2,
or even your custom ones - to other formats such as FHIR or custom ones.

as well as information on how to contact us when you have additional needs, such as a custom implementation
or support contract.
