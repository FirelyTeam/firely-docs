Getting started
===============

The FHIR Mapper is available as a paid plugin to the Vonk FHIR server. `Get in touch <https://fire.ly/contact/>`_ with us if you're interested in obtaining it for your needs. Alternatively, you can try the FHIR Mapper in our `public test sandbox <https://vonk.fire.ly/>`_. All operations described in this documentation are accessible for testing purposes.
