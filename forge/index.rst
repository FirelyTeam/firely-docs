**********************************
Welcome to Forge's documentation!
**********************************

Conformance Resources ("*Profiles*") are an important aspect of the FHIR standard. 
They allow you to tailor FHIR to your needs and define how exchanging partners use the FHIR specification. 
Profiles have an international, a national, regional or local scope, or are designed for specific use cases.

Creating and maintaining these files by hand using an XML editor or an Excel sheet is error-prone and requires detailed knowledge of the Profile resource. 
Forge is the user-friendly editor for creating and editing profiles that enables modelers to create and manage profiles using a graphical user-interface.
