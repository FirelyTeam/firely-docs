Edit profiles
=============

Within Forge you can differentiate between the five tabs which are shown in the screenshot below. 
This section describes these tabs in more detail.

Properties and Narrative
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In Forge you can edit the properties of a Profile as well as the elements of the Profile. 
Properties of the Profile are, for example, the profile URL, name, and publishing date. 
These values can be edited under the 'Properties' tab. 
A profile's narrative can be adjusted under the 'Narrative' tab. 
The narrative is a XHMTL fragment which is intended  to contain a summary of the resource and is used to represent the content of the resource to a human.
On default this is a Generated Narrative of the profile, meaning the content is entirely generated from the structured data in the profile.
 

Element Tree and Element Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Elements of the FHIR base Resource and extension can be edited to make your own profile. 
In Forge you can view and edit these elements in the Element Tree or in the Element Grid.

Via the Element Tree you can edit Element Properties, slice Elements, or add extensions.

XML viewer
^^^^^^^^^^
The last tab is the XML viewer of the current profile. 
The XML viewer only shows the differential. 
A snapshot can be obtained by saving your work after the option 'Save snapshot component' is checked in the Options menu.
