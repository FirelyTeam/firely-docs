Define slices
=============

To further customize a base Resource you can slice available elements to capture a variety of the same element. 
This is particularly helpful when you want to capture multiple versions of an element of your base Resource. 
For instance multiple patient identifiers or multiple name parts. 
This allows you to define specifics such as CodeableConcepts for each part of the sliced object. 
This process entails `slicing` a structure element into sub items. 
The sub items that are created are then referred to as slices. 

Slicing in Forge
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Select the element that you want to slice and click on the scissor icon. 
The element is now ‘Sliced’ and it is possible to add slices by clicking the scissor icon with a little plus. 
You can create as many slices as necessary by selecting the sliced element and clicking the `Add Slice` icon again. 
The added slices can be defined and constrained as any other element. 

Discriminator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
After adding slices, Forge shows a warning message containing the message that there is no discriminator defined for the sliced elements. The discriminator is used to distinguish the sliced elements from one another. The discriminators in their sum should allow  applications to easily determine which slice belong to each section. 
The discriminator information can be provided in the `Element Properties` of the sliced element under `Slicing Details`.

*New Feature -* Type Slicing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Forge 14.7 provides improved support for so-called type slicing. This applies to so-called
polymorphic “choice type” elements that support multiple data types. A choice
type element has a name that ends with “[x] ”, 
e.g. Observation.value[x]. Using type slicing, you can define
constraints for specific element types. Per definition, the slicing
discriminator of a type slice is equal to “@type”. Each slice constraint you
define must have a unique type.
