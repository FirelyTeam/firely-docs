# Edit Profiles

Within Forge you can differentiate between the five tabs which are shown
in the screenshot below. This section describes these tabs in more
detail.

## Properties and Narrative

In Forge you can edit the properties of a Profile as well as the
elements of the Profile. Properties of the Profile are, for example, the
profile URL, name, and publishing date. These values can be edited under
the \'Properties\' tab. A profile\'s narrative can be adjusted under the
\'Narrative\' tab. The narrative is a XHMTL fragment which is intended
to contain a summary of the resource and is used to represent the
content of the resource to a human. On default this is a Generated
Narrative of the profile, meaning the content is entirely generated from
the structured data in the profile. 

## Element Tree and Element Grid

Elements of the FHIR base Resource and extension can be edited to make
your own profile. In Forge you can view and edit these elements in the
Element Tree or in the Element Grid. 

### Element Tree

Via the Element Tree you can edit Element Properties, slice Elements, or
add extensions.

## XML viewer

The last tab is the XML viewer of the current profile. The XML viewer
only shows the differential. A snapshot can be obtained by saving your
work after the option \'Save snapshot component\' is checked in the
Options menu.
