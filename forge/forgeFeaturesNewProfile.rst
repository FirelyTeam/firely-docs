Create new Profiles
===================


Forge enables you to create your own FHIR Profiles, based on one of the FHIR base resources.
To open a base resource and start editing, you can select *New Profile* (or Ctrl + N) from the File menu. 
This will open a window in which you can select one of the base Resources or DataTypes.

If you selected the base Resource you need, you can start to create your own Profile based on this Resource. 
The different options you can use in editing your Profile will be explained in the following sections.
