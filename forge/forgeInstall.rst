Click once installer
====================

Forge is deployed using a click once installer. 
So it automatically updates to the newest version when you start the application. 
After installation of a new release, you will again receive automatic update notifications on application startup.

We moved Forge to a new deployment location. 
As a result existing installations of the previous DSTU-2 alpha release will no longer automatically detect the new update. 
Therefore we strongly advise you to uninstall the earlier DSTU-2 alpha release manually before installing this new version.
