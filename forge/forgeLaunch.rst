Launching Forge
===============

Start Menu
~~~~~~~~~~

The easiest way to launch Forge is via the start menu shortcut that the ClickOnce installer creates during the installation.
Alternatively, open the start menu and search for "Forge". Windows should locate and display the shortcut to Forge.
You can manually pin the shortcut to the start menu or the taskbar for your convenience.

Command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also start Forge from the command line.
This allows you to launch Forge programmatically, from other applications.

The ClickOnce installer deploys the application to a personalized AppData subfolder that is hard to locate.
However you can open the installation folder via the Forge Options menu, command "Open application folder".

You can launch the application from code in different ways:

- directly, via the main executable Forge.exe  
  First, you need to determine the installation folder that contains the main executable "Forge.exe".
  Unfortunately, the ClickOnce installer deploys the application to a personalized AppData subfolder that is hard to find.
  However you can locate the installation folder via the Forge Options menu, command "Open application folder".
  
- indirectly, via the start menu shortcut  
  You can also launch the start menu shortcut created by the ClickOnce installer from code.
  The start menu shortcut is always created in a fixed location with the following path:
  
	%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Firely\Firely FHIR Tools\Forge for HL7 FHIR STU3.appref-ms

  Alternatively, you can create or generate an ".appref-ms" shortcut in a well-known location.
  The shortcut is a single-line text file with the following contents:
  	
	http://downloads.simplifier.net/forge/stu3/Forge.application#Forge.application, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=d35f0fdbb3d5e195, processorArchitecture=msil
	
Command line arguments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The main Forge executable accepts command line arguments.
You can specify one or more documents to open:

	Forge.exe [filePath] [filePath] [...]

The specified arguments must be fully qualified absolute file paths.
After startup, Forge will try to load all the specified files, if they exist.

If you launch Forge indirectly via the ".appref-ms" shortcut, then you can also specify a single (!) command line argument.
For example:

	"%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Firely\Firely FHIR Tools\Forge for HL7 FHIR STU3.appref-ms" "C:\Profiles\MyPatient.xml"

Unlike the main executable, the ".appref-ms" shortcut does not accept multiple command line arguments.
This is a limitation of the ClickOnce installer technology.
