Resources
=========
Simplifier is a repository for FHIR resources. There are a multitude of resources that are available to the public including profiles, extensions, valuesets, dictionaries, mappings, examples and more. 

Resource page
"""""""""""""
You can visit the page of a resource by selecting the resource from your search results or the ``Resources`` tab in your project, or following the direct link to the resource. While viewing resources you can display information in a few different ways.  

Depending on the type of resource, the different views include:

* **Overview** – This is either a preview (e.g. texts) or a Logical view (e.g. profiles) of the resource. The Logical view of a profile includes Element names in the leftmost column followed by Flags, Cardinality, Type, and  Description & Constraints.
* **Narrative** - This is a preview of the narrative part of an example Resource, e.g. a Patient.
* **Details** – This is an easy-to-read list per element of all the details of a profile. The specification refers to this as the dictionary. 
* **Mappings** - This is a list of all the mappings specified in a profile.
* **Table** – This is a simple table view of the resource.
* **XML & JSON** – Respective views of resources in either XML or JSON formatting. 
* **History** – On this tab you can view the difference between two versions of the same profile. This is a great feature for comparing and tracking changes.
* **Issues** - On this tab users with a paid account can track issues. New issues can be created by clicking the ``New issue`` button. The issue list can be filtered on open, closed or your own issues. By clicking on an issue you can read the entire conversation and add a new comment.

Update Resources
""""""""""""""""
When you want to update your resource, there are several ways to do so. Choose one of the following options from the ``Update`` menu at the top of the Resource page:

* **Upload**: Update by uploading a file (either XML or JSON)
* **Fetch**: Update by fetching from a different FHIR server (provide a GET request to the server where your resource is located)
* **Edit**: Update by editing the last version (opens a XML-editor where you can directly edit the XML code of your resource)

Download Resources
""""""""""""""""""
You may also choose to download the resource and save a local copy on your computer. You can either choose to download the resource as a XML or JSON file or directly copy the XML or JSON code of the resource to your clipboard, so you can easily copy-paste it to another location.

Add Resources
"""""""""""""
Go to your Project page to `add new resources <simplifierProjects.html#add-resources-to-your-project>`_ to your project.
