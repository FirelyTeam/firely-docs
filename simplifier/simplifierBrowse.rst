Browse existing projects
========================
To explore existing projects and resources simply type a search phrase into the ``Search`` field at the top of the Simplifier homepage. This search allows you to browse through publicly available resources and projects. Once you reach the page with your search results you will notice that you have a few options to further specify your results. In the left hand menu you will find options to limit the results to Projects.

You can use these filters to search for more specific projects. For example you can filter based on Project Scope. This allows you to make a distinction between Core, International, National, Local, and Regional projects. If you select the National Project Scope, the Nationality filter option will open. Here you can select one or more nationalities.

A recent addition to the search feature is the ability to search by organization. This allows you to easily find an organization's work and profile. Click Organization under Search Type and type the name of the company you are interested in.

Your search results are now RESTful, meaning that you can send your search results exactly as you have edited them to another using the URL. The person that you are sending the results to will receive the search results just as you have filtered them. 

Each project contains a couple of tabs depending on the settings of the project and your role in the project. The tabs described below are visible for each user in each Simplifier project. The other tabs will be explained in the following sections.

Introduction
------------
On the ``Introduction`` tab you can find:

- A Project summary as added by the project owners
- A summary table describing the contents of the project:
 - Total number of resources per resource type
 - Total number of examples per resource type
- The canonical base URLs supported in the project
- The workflow statuses supported in the project

When clicking on a resource type in the summary table (e.g. profiles) you navigate to the ``Resources`` tab, where the resources will be filtered on the selected resource type.

Resources
---------
On the ``Resources`` tab you can find all the Conformance and Example Resources for the project.
This tab also offers a search and filter option. You can filter your results to include or exclude certain Resource categories, Core base types, Example Resources type, FHIR status, and Workflow status. 
 
Guides
------
The ``Guides`` tab shows all Implementation Guides for this project built in Simplifier. Click on the Guide or hit the ``Browse`` button to go to the Implementation Guide. 
 
Members
-------
On the ``Members`` tab you can find all project members and their role. This tab also offers a search option, allowing you to search for other members using their full name or username.

Log
---
On the ``Log`` tab you can see all the changes that have been made to this project in the past. This is a good way to stay in touch with whats happening within your favorite projects. 

Issues

On the ``Issues` tab you can leave your issues regarding the project. Note that this tab is not visible in all projects. The Issue Tracker is a paid functionality that allows project members to collect feedback from other project members or (depending on the project settings) other Simplifier users.

Milestones
----------
The ``Milestones`` tab shows all released versions of a project. Project members may use this beta functionality to release project versions containing (a selection of) resources as a package.
