Embedded Rendering
==================

Simplifier enables rendering of profiles as tree, UML or table for all users. 
Users with an enterprise account can also embed rendering in their own website by using the following URL and copying it into their own code:

https://www.simplifier.net/embed/render?id=[Name of your project]/[Name of your resource]

For example, https://www.simplifier.net/embed/render?id=STU3DemoProject/nl-core-patient shows an example of embedded rendering of the nl-core-patient from a demo project of Nictiz.

   <iframe src=https://www.simplifier.net/embed/render?id=STU3DemoProject/nl-core-patient height="345px" width="100%"></iframe>
 
Note that this only works for public projects that are created by a user with an enterprise account.
