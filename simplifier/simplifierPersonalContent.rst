Personal Portal
"""""""""""""""
All your personal content is accessible through your personal portal. The following tabs are available:

* **Projects**: On this tab you can create new projects and/or manage your existing projects.
* **Bookmarks**: Use this tab to quickly access your favourite projects and publications. You can bookmark projects or resources by using the ``Bookmark`` button at the top right corner of the Project or Resource page. 
* **Connectors**: Here you can create and edit your connectors or shop for new connectors.
* **Organizations**: This tab shows an overview of the organizations you are part of. You can access your organizations' portals from here or create a new organization if you have the rights to do so.
* **Implementation guides**: In older versions of Simplifier, this was the place to create and edit implementation guides, but they are moved to projects. Old implementation guides that are not yet linked to a project can still be accessed here. If you want to have your guide moved to a project, please contact us by using the feedback button on the top right.

Invites Page
""""""""""""
On the invites page you see an overview of the projects that you were invited to. You can either accept or decline the invite.
