FHIR Registry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The `FHIR registry <https://registry.fhir.org//>`_ enables you to search for published FHIR resources created for STU3 in International, National, Institute or Regional projects on Simplifier.net. Test projects are excluded. The aim of this registry is to encourage re-use of profiles and extensions by providing a centralised search location for all of them. The registry supports free-text search as well as the following parameters:

* resourceType: search by resource type, (e.g. resourceType:Patient)
* jurisdiction: search by jurisdiction code in a conformance resource (e.g. jurisdiction:US)
