and publishing the artifacts from, FHIR specifications.

Notes
~~~~~

General notes

* Simplifier.net is a platform for user-generated content. While we do our best to facilitate
  our users in creating accessible content, the flexibility of the platform requires users to
  check their own generated content for accessibility.

* The tree rendering of FHIR resources can be navigated by keyboard when Javascript is enabled:
  
  - Tab until the full three is selected.
  - Then navigate the three rows with the up and down arrows. When using a screen reader this
    can be done after 'Scan mode' is turned off.
  - Three nodes can be opened/collapsed by selecting the node and pressing Space bar or Enter.

  The Details page on a resource and dictionary rendering in an Implementation Guide provide
  static alternatives.

* The Monaco Editor which is embedded in many places on the site provides powerfull accessibility
  features and a dedicated menu which is highlighted when using a screen reader. More information
  can be found in the `Monaco Editor Accessibility Guide <https://github.com/microsoft/monaco-editor/wiki/Monaco-Editor-Accessibility-Guide>`_.

Changelog

* Nov 30, 2020: First edition published.
* Dec 22, 2020: Accessibility scan completed and major issues resolved.
