Introduction to Simplifier.net
==============================

Simplifier.net is a FHIR registry. Within this registry you can
create, upload, download, find and view FHIR Conformance Resources.
Simplifier.net offers functionality for management of FHIR Resources
and collaboration in teams. 

FHIR (Fast Health Interoperability Resources) is an HL7 standard for information exchange in health care. It is based on Internet
technology. More information about FHIR can be found at `HL7 FHIR <http://www.hl7.org/fhir/>`_.

FHIR Profiling
--------------

The FHIR Profiling tool `Forge (https://fire.ly/forge) <https://fire.ly/forge>`_ can be
used off-line and independently from Simplifier.net.

Simplifier accounts
-------------------

Simplifier.net distinguishes between free (personal) plans and paid
plans. Anyone can find and download Resources in this Registry, with
or without an account. Creating Resources requires an account. Paid
plans are targeted at professional users and organizations.

Simplifier content
------------------

Simplifier content is organized at four levels: Users, Resources, Projects and Organizations.

Users have access to a personal environment as well as free or paid features depending on their account level. 

Simplifier is a repository for FHIR resources. There are a multitude of resources that are available to the public including profiles, extensions, valuesets, dictionaries, mappings, examples and more. 

All FHIR resources are organized in projects, which can be either public or private. Each user can add one public project for free (paid accounts allow for adding more or private projects), making him/her the owner of the project. Depending on the account level more projects can be added. The features available in the project depend on the project settings as well as the account level.

Organizations only exist for the highest account plan. One or more projects and users can be added to an organization.
