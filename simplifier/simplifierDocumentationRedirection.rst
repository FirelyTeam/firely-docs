Documentation Redirection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Each project and resource in Simplifier has a Documentation URL. If set, users that go to https://simplifier.net/resolve and enter a canonical URL will get automatically directed to that documentation url. The default (fallback) will be the resource page on Simplifier itself. To edit the documentation URL of your project or resource, click on ``Options`` at the project or resource page and choose ``Edit documentation URL``

These documentation URL are templates. 
You can provide (FHIR type), (the type that a structure definition describes) and of the resource.
